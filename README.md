# SIFT/SURF/Corner Edge Detection Algorithm
Feature detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, used for object recognition, image
stitching, and motion tracking. Several key techniques include:

● SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) – Detects and describes key points that are
invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes, widely used in object recognition.
● SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) – A faster alternative to SIFT, using integral
images for efficient feature extraction, making it suitable for real-time applications.
● Harris Corner Detector – Identifies corner points based on changes in image intensity,
commonly used in motion tracking and image registration.
● Canny Edge Detection – A multi-step algorithm that detects edges by finding intensity
gradients, reducing noise, and applying non-maximum suppression for accurate edge
localization.

These techniques help extract meaningful features from images, aiding in various real-world
applications such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and object tracking.
